# Hello Everyone!

## Why this workshop?

Over the last couple of years, I've developed this somewhat unhealthy obsession with visualizing data.

As time went by, I started to realize how much UX Laws and dataviz had in common, and it was all I thought about.

I hope to pass on my excitement so that you too can see and explore the possibilities.

## About this Workshop

My main goal is to get you excited to explore the data around you, and to share some ways of achieving this.

We will be using `Vue.js` and `D3.js` to provide data manipulation in a reactive environment, and to show how powerful these two concepts are when used together.

We will start small by going over some features in both libraries, and work our way up to creating some nice visuals.

Hierarchical data will be our main focus for visualizing, however you will learn patterns that can be used in other aspects of data visualization.

Let's have some fun with Vue and D3!
