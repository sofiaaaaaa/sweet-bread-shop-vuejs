# Law of Prägnanz

The fundamental principle of gestalt perception is the law of Prägnanz (in the German language, pithiness), which says that **we tend to order our experience in a manner that is regular, orderly, symmetrical, and simple**.

Principles that, hypothetically, allow us to predict the interpretation of sensation, often called `"gestalt laws"`

Implies that the mind understands external stimuli as _whole_ rather than the sum of their parts. The wholes are structured and organized using `grouping laws`.

## Law of Proximity

States that when an individual perceives an assortment of objects, they perceive objects that are close to each other as forming a group.

## Law of Similarity

States that elements within an assortment of objects are perceptually grouped together if they are similar to each other.

## Law of Closure

States that individuals perceive objects such as shapes, letters, pictures, etc., as being whole when they are not complete. Specifically, when parts of a whole picture are missing, our perception fills in the visual gap.

## Law of Symmetry

States that the mind perceives objects as being symmetrical and forming around a center point. It is perceptually pleasing to divide objects into an even number of symmetrical parts.

## Law of Common Fate

States that objects are perceived as lines that move along the smoothest path. Experiments using the visual sensory modality found that movement of elements of an object produce paths that individuals perceive that the objects are on.

## Law of Continuity

States that elements of objects tend to be grouped together, and therefore integrated into perceptual wholes if they are aligned within an object. In cases where there is an intersection between objects, individuals tend to perceive the two objects as two single uninterrupted entities.
